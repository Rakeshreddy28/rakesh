Hi All,

Today is my last working day at M3bi. I am bidding adieu to this company to pursue other career opportunities. As I move on, I would like to take a moment to remember and cherish our times together. It’s been great interacting and knowing each one of you.

Especially I would like to thank Director Suresh Potluri and my manager Vamsi Mailavaram for their support and guidance throughout.

Even though I will miss you all here I am looking forward to this new challenge and to start a new phase of my career. 

I hope that our paths will continue to cross. Looking forward to stay in touch.
